# EQST-GP-thory
EQST-GP stands for Extended Quantum String Theory with Gluon Plasma It is a unified theory that aims to describe all the fundamental forces in the universe (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear) within a single framework. Numerical codes/ datasets generated during this study Code as an interactive extension active simulation 
Using:

Extra spacetime dimensions (11 dimensions, as in M-theory).

Concepts from string theory and loop quantum gravity.

A role for gluon plasmas (negative-energy matter) to explain dark matter and dark energy.

The main goals of the theory:
Unifying particle physics with gravity (quantum theory + general relativity).

Deriving fundamental constants (proton mass, fine structure constant, etc.) from first principles without computation.

Interpreting dark matter as a negative-energy quark-gluon foam.

Interpreting dark energy through the volume of this expanding plasma.

Providing testable predictions from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), gravitational wave observations (LIGO), and telescope data (JWST).

Applying quantum ideas to artificial intelligence (optimizing mathematical functions using quantum entanglement).
Key ideas and results in the draft:

Integrating relativistic energy + string vibration energy + dark energy contribution from the plasma.

2. Deriving the proton mass with high accuracy.
A theoretical value is presented that matches the measured value with precision:
938.2720813

MeV
938.2720813MeV.

3. Deriving the fine structure constant
α
α
with a theoretical value:

α
−
1
=
137.035999084
α
−1
=137.035999084
which is very close to the measured value.

4. Modifying the Friedmann equations in cosmology
to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe and solve the Hubble tension problem by adding a gluon plasma.

5. Derivation of the CPMNS and CKM matrix
to describe the mixing of quarks and neutrinos, with good agreement with experimental data.

6. Interpretation of black holes and entropy
with modifications due to gluon plasma.

7. Applications in Artificial Intelligence
A loss function was designed to ensure that the laws of physics are respected during model training.

Testable predictions:
Gravitational wave signals at frequencies of 100–300 Hz.

Unusual redshift patterns in distant galaxies (JWST data).

Effects in hadron collisions at the LHC.

Therefore, we hope to use the provided code as a starting point for more advanced simulations, and to create a repository that includes the development chain and codes for simulation and numerical analysis, as well as simplifications for Monte Carlo computation and modeling algorithms, MetaLab, numpy, etc.
