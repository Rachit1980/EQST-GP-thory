Analysis of an MCMC code to investigate the cosmological EDE model.
📋 Code Overview
This code performs Bayesian inference using the MCMC (affine-invariant) algorithm to compare the early dark energy (EDE) model with cosmological data.

🔍 Main Scientific Purpose
Objective: To test the hypothesis of an "early dark energy" that could resolve the Hubble tension (H0 tension) between Planck and SH0ES measurements.
Methodology:

EDE MCMC: Uses Bayesian inference with MCMC

Scope of Analysis:

EDE MCMC: Focuses on the dynamics and expansion of the universe from EQST-GP perspective.

Comparison Between the Best Model and the Data

Comparison with the Standard ΛCDM Model
Scientific Importance
Resolving the Hubble Tension:
Problem: 4-6σ discrepancy between local and distant H0 measurements

Proposed Solution: EDE could modify early cosmic history

Testing New Physics:
The model examines deviations from ΛCDM

Tries to reconcile discrepant observations

Evaluation of Current Code
Strengths:
✅ Correct implementation of MCMC

✅ Appropriate handling of multi-source data

✅ Comprehensive output of results

✅ Consideration of data interdependencies

Points for Improvement:
Incomplete CC data (could be improved)

Lack of complete C-constraint analysis

Bayesian analysis could be added for model comparison
